    <h2>Process for Registering a MIME Type</h2>
    <section id="sec-general">
      <h3>General</h3>
      <p>
        Listed below are the steps to register with IANA a new MIME Type based on a SMPTE Engineering Document 
        using their Standards Tree registration described in IETF RFC 6838. If a corresponding MIME Type 
        already exists, then there is no need to go through this process.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        IANA, in accordance with RFC 6838, requires the final registration template to be published in an 
        Engineering Document. The template should be published as an Annex of the document that defines the 
        media type (either as part of the original publication, as an amendment, or as a revision). In most 
        cases, the Engineering Document type should be a Standard. An RP may be used if the defining document 
        is an RP. If the registration applies to multiple standards, the registration may be published as an 
        Amendment to any of the referenced Standards or as a separate RP.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        An example of the body text for an Amendment that specifies a MIME Type Registration Template is 
        shown in Annex B.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The following steps in this section shall be performed.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="sec-preparation">
      <h3>Preparation</h3>
      
      <p>
        The Editor should read the following RFCs (or RFCs that have obsoleted them) 
        before proceeding with an application for a MIME Type. It is important to understand 
        the application process and requirements completely. These documents are the standards 
        for Media Types:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/go/rfc2045">RFC 2045</a> – MIME formats and encodings</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/go/rfc2046">RFC 2046</a> – Definition of media types</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/go/rfc2077">RFC 2077</a> – Model top-level media type</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/go/rfc7303">RFC 7303</a> – XML Media Types</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/go/rfc6657">RFC 6657</a> – Update to MIME regarding “charset” Parameter Handling in Textual Media Types</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/go/rfc6838">RFC 6838</a> – Media type specifications and registration procedures</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing the research and verifying that there is not an existing MIME 
        Type that can be referenced, the Editor should collect the information required 
        in RFC 6838 to register the MIME Type and populating a draft registration template, 
        such as the one in section <a href="#sec-annex-a"></a>.

      <h3>Draft Registration</h3>
      <p>
        The Engineering Document follows the due process defined in the Standards 
        OM. If desired, the Editor may request that the TC Chair submit a 
        provisional registration request once the project is approved to hold 
        the type name. Once the CD has been finalized, the Editor shall request 
        that the TC Chair submit the draft registration request to IANA.

      <h3>IANA Response to Application</h3>
      <p>
        IANA is generally responsive and will likely send a confirmation that the 
        draft registration has been received and in some cases might request 
        additional information. For instance, if the referenced standard is behind a 
        paywall, the TC chair should be prepared to supply a liaison copy of the referenced standard. 
        The TC Chair should ensure that the IANA representative understands that SMPTE is 
        requesting expert feedback on the submission. The submitting TC chair shall submit any 
        feedback received as one or more comments against the FCD ballot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SMPTE Engineering Document development process is then followed. Further changes 
        may be made as a result of document reviews or comment resolution according to the due 
        process defined by the Standards OM.

    </section>
  
    <section id="sec-publication">
      <h3>Publication</h3>
      <p>
        Once the document has been published, the Editor should notify the Director of 
        Standards to submit the final registration. The registration template information 
        should be copied directly from the published document, and the “Provisional Registrations” 
        field is set to “No”, as the request represents the final registration, and with 
        the “Other Information & Comments” field filled as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
<code>
This registration request corresponds to a previously accepted provisional registration request. 
The related SMPTE document has since been formally published as represented herein. 
Final publication of this registration is respectfully requested.
</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Director of Standards should forward the tracking number back to the 
        Editor for tracking the progress of the request to Acceptance.

<code><b>1 Scope</b>
This amendment contains the registration template for the image/dpx MIME type.
<b>2 Add New Annex D</b>
The following text is added as Annex D:
<b>Annex D	IANA MIME Type Registration Template (informative)</b>
This annex serves to register and document the MIME Type image/dpx, which is associated with files conforming to SMPTE ST 268-1 or SMPTE ST 268-2. The registration is intended to address the requirements of IETF RFC 6838.
<b>D.1 Media type name</b>
image
<b>D.2 Media subtype name</b>
dpx
<b>D.3 Required parameters</b>
N/A
<b>D.4 Optional parameters</b>
<code>standard</code> – If specified, the parameter indicates the version of the SMPTE standard with which the file complies. At the time of IANA registration, the possible values are <code>st268-1</code> (for SMPTE ST 268-1) and <code>st268-2</code> (for SMPTE ST 268-2). 
If the <code>standard</code> parameter is absent, the file can comply with any version of the SMPTE standard.
<b>D.5 Encoding considerations</b>
binary
<b>D.6 Security considerations</b>
DPX files only encode images with corresponding metadata and do not employ executable content.
The header defines a "user-defined information" section that can contain arbitrary binary data. As such, a maliciously coded file could contain a binary blob comprising executable content. Therefore, the user-defined header must not contain executable content, and implementations that receive, display, or otherwise process images must preclude the execution of any executable content that might be received.
Some files also contain a “standards-based metadata” section that can include arbitrary XML. Such XML could include potentially harmful or malicious links to other resources.
Implementations will need to ensure that a received file can be handled within the available memory. DPX allows run-length encoding, so decoders will need suitable bounds checks to ensure that memory locations outside the allocated decoded image buffer cannot be altered.
DPX files do not have integral encryption or authentication. A 32-bit “encryption key” field is defined in SMPTE ST 268-1, but the standard does not specify an encryption algorithm; therefore, utilizing the field for encrypting picture data will generally not be interoperable. Any file protection, privacy, or integrity requirements must be handled using an external mechanism.
<b>D.7 Interoperability considerations</b>
SMPTE ST 268-1 has been very widely used since it was standardized (initially as SMPTE 268M:1994) but has experienced some interoperability issues in practice. These issues have occurred primarily due to conflicting interpretations relating specifically to how the pixel data is ordered, packed, and padded. SMPTE ST 268-2 has improved interoperability due to the inclusion of metadata that resolves ambiguities that are present in ST 268-1. However, ST 268-2 is a more recent standard, whereas ST 268-1 has been widely used for many years prior and is employed in voluminous archives.
Both ST 268-1 and ST 268-2 define core fields and values. Files must include all core fields, and reader or receiver implementations must interpret all core fields and values.
<b>D.8 Published specification</b>
SMPTE ST 268-1; SMPTE ST 268-2 (which incorporates ST 268-1 by reference)
<b>D.9 Applications which use this media</b>
DPX is derived from Kodak's Cineon format and is used primarily as a file format for digitization of camera-captured frames and as a digital intermediate file format.
<b>D.10 Fragment identifier considerations</b>
N/A
<b>D.11 Restrictions on usage</b>
N/A
<b>D.12 Additional information</b>
<b>D.12.1 Deprecated alias names for this type

<b>D.12.2 Magic number(s)</b>
