    <h2>Process for Registering a MIME Type</h2>
    <section id="sec-general">
      <h3>General</h3>
      <p>
        Listed below are the steps to register with IANA a new MIME Type based on a SMPTE Engineering Document 
        using their Standards Tree registration described in IETF RFC 6838. If a corresponding MIME Type 
        already exists, then there is no need to go through this process.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        IANA, in accordance with RFC 6838, requires the final registration template to be published in an 
        Engineering Document. The template should be published as an Annex of the document that defines the 
        media type (either as part of the original publication, as an amendment, or as a revision). In most 
        cases, the Engineering Document type should be a Standard. An RP may be used if the defining document 
        is an RP. If the registration applies to multiple standards, the registration may be published as an 
        Amendment to any of the referenced Standards or as a separate RP.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        An example of the body text for an Amendment that specifies a MIME Type Registration Template is 
        shown in Annex B.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The following steps in this section shall be performed.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="sec-preparation">
      <h3>Preparation</h3>
      
      <p>
        The Editor should read the following RFCs (or RFCs that have obsoleted them) 
        before proceeding with an application for a MIME Type. It is important to understand 
        the application process and requirements completely. These documents are the standards 
        for Media Types:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/go/rfc2045">RFC 2045</a> – MIME formats and encodings</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/go/rfc2046">RFC 2046</a> – Definition of media types</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/go/rfc2077">RFC 2077</a> – Model top-level media type</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/go/rfc7303">RFC 7303</a> – XML Media Types</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/go/rfc6657">RFC 6657</a> – Update to MIME regarding “charset” Parameter Handling in Textual Media Types</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/go/rfc6838">RFC 6838</a> – Media type specifications and registration procedures</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing the research and verifying that there is not an existing MIME 
        Type that can be referenced, the Editor should collect the information required 
        in RFC 6838 to register the MIME Type and populating a draft registration template, 
        such as the one in <a href="#sec-annex-a">Annex A – Draft Application Template</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
  
    <section id="sec-draft-registration">
      <h3>Draft Registration</h3>
      <p>
        The Engineering Document follows the due process defined in the Standards 
        OM. If desired, the Editor may request that the TC Chair submit a 
        provisional registration request once the project is approved to hold 
        the type name. Once the CD has been finalized, the Editor shall request 
        that the TC Chair submit the draft registration request to IANA.

      <h3>Online Application</h3>

        with the following information from the approved template. Any items that are not 
        applicable shall be filled out with N/A. Do not use words like “none” that 
        might be interpreted incorrectly.

      <h3>IANA Response to Application</h3>
      <p>
        IANA is generally responsive and will likely send a confirmation that the 
        draft registration has been received and in some cases might request 
        additional information. For instance, if the referenced standard is behind a 
        paywall, the TC chair should be prepared to supply a liaison copy of the referenced standard. 
        The TC Chair should ensure that the IANA representative understands that SMPTE is 
        requesting expert feedback on the submission. The submitting TC chair shall submit any 
        feedback received as one or more comments against the FCD ballot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SMPTE Engineering Document development process is then followed. Further changes 
        may be made as a result of document reviews or comment resolution according to the due 
        process defined by the Standards OM.
      </p>
    </section>
  
    <section id="sec-publication">
      <h3>Publication</h3>
      <p>
        Once the document has been published, the Editor should notify the Director of 
        Standards to submit the final registration. The registration template information 
        should be copied directly from the published document, and the “Provisional Registrations” 
        field is set to “No”, as the request represents the final registration, and with 
        the “Other Information & Comments” field filled as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
        This registration request corresponds to a previously accepted provisional registration request. 
        The related SMPTE document has since been formally published as represented herein. 
        Final publication of this registration is respectfully requested.
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Director of Standards should forward the tracking number back to the 
        Editor for tracking the progress of the request to Acceptance.
