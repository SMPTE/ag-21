    <h2>Process for Registering a MIME Type</h2>
    <section id="sec-general">
      <h3>General</h3>
      <p>
        Listed below are the steps to register with IANA a new MIME Type based on a SMPTE Engineering Document using their Standards Tree registration described in <a href="#bib-ietf-rfc-6838"></a>. If a corresponding MIME Type already exists, then there is no need to go through this process.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        IANA, in accordance with <a href="#bib-ietf-rfc-6838"></a>, requires the final registration template to be published in an Engineering Document. The template should be published as an Annex of the document that defines the media type (either as part of the original publication, as an amendment, or as a revision). In most cases, the Engineering Document type should be a Standard. An RP may be used if the defining document is an RP. If the registration applies to multiple standards, the registration may be published as an Amendment to any of the referenced Standards or as a separate RP.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        An example of the body text for an Amendment that specifies a MIME Type Registration Template is shown in <a href="#sec-example-registration"></a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The following steps in this section shall be performed.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="sec-preparation">
      <h3>Preparation</h3>
      
      <p>
        The Editor should read the following RFCs (or RFCs that have obsoleted them) before proceeding with an application for a MIME Type. It is important to understand the application process and requirements completely. These documents are the standards for Media Types: </p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="#bib-ietf-rfc-2045"></a> – MIME formats and encodings</li>
          <li><a href="#bib-ietf-rfc-2046"></a> – Definition of media types</li>
          <li><a href="#bib-ietf-rfc-2077"></a> – Model top-level media type</li>
          <li><a href="#bib-ietf-rfc-6657"></a> – Update to MIME regarding “charset” Parameter Handling in Textual Media Types</li>
          <li><a href="#bib-ietf-rfc-6838"></a> – Media type specifications and registration procedures</li>
          <li><a href="#bib-ietf-rfc-7303"></a> – XML Media Types</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        After completing the research and verifying that there is not an existing MIME Type that can be referenced, the Editor should collect the information required in <a href="#bib-ietf-rfc-6838"></a> to register the MIME Type and populating a draft registration template, such as the one in <a href="#sec-draft-application-template"></a>.

    <section id="sec-draft-registration">
      <h3>Draft Registration</h3>
      <p>
        The Engineering Document follows the due process defined in the <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a>. If desired, the Editor may request that the TC Chair submit a provisional registration request once the project is approved to hold the type name. Once the CD has been finalized, the Editor shall request that the TC Chair submit the draft registration request to IANA.

      <h3>IANA Response to Application</h3>
      <p>
        IANA is generally responsive and will likely send a confirmation that the draft registration has been received and in some cases might request additional information. For instance, if the referenced standard is behind a paywall, the TC chair should be prepared to supply a liaison copy of the referenced standard. The TC Chair should ensure that the IANA representative understands that SMPTE is requesting expert feedback on the submission. The submitting TC chair shall submit any feedback received as one or more comments against the FCD ballot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SMPTE Engineering Document development process is then followed. Further changes may be made as a result of document reviews or comment resolution according to the due process defined by the <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a>.

      <h3>Publication</h3>
      <p>
        Once the document has been published, the Editor should notify the Director of Standards to submit the final registration. The registration template information should be copied directly from the published document, and the <code>Provisional Registrations</code> field is set to <code>No</code>, as the request represents the final registration, and with the <code>Other Information & Comments</code> field filled as follows:
      </p>

<pre>
This registration request corresponds to a previously accepted provisional registration request. 
The related SMPTE document has since been formally published as represented herein. 
Final publication of this registration is respectfully requested.

    <h2>Example Registration</h2>
    <p>
      The following is the body text of an example Amendment (Amd1:2022 to ST 268-2:2018), which specifies the registration template used for the <code>image/dpx</code> MIME type.
    </p>
   
<pre>
1  Scope 
This amendment contains the registration template for the image/dpx MIME type.

2  Add New Annex D
<em>The following text is added as Annex D:</em>

  Annex D IANA MIME Type Registration Template (informative)
  This annex serves to register and document the MIME Type image/dpx, which is associated with files 
  conforming to SMPTE ST 268-1 or SMPTE ST 268-2. The registration is intended to address the 
  requirements of <a href="#bib-ietf-rfc-6838"></a>.

  D.1 Media type name
  image

  D.2 Media subtype name
  dpx

  D.3 Required parameters
  N/A

  D.4 Optional parameters
  standard – If specified, the parameter indicates the version of the SMPTE standard with which the 
  file complies. At the time of IANA registration, the possible values are st268-1 (for SMPTE ST 268-1) 
  and st268-2 (for SMPTE ST 268-2). 

  If the standard parameter is absent, the file can comply with any version of the SMPTE standard.

  D.5 Encoding considerations
  binary

  D.6 Security considerations
  DPX files only encode images with corresponding metadata and do not employ executable content.
   
  The header defines a "user-defined information" section that can contain arbitrary binary data. As 
  such, a maliciously coded file could contain a binary blob comprising executable content. Therefore, 
  the user-defined header must not contain executable content, and implementations that receive, 
  display, or otherwise process images must preclude the execution of any executable content that 
  ight be received.

  Some files also contain a “standards-based metadata” section that can include arbitrary XML. Such 
  XML could include potentially harmful or malicious links to other resources. Implementations will 
  need to ensure that a received file can be handled within the available memory. DPX allows 
  run-length encoding, so decoders will need suitable bounds checks to ensure that memory locations 
  outside the allocated decoded image buffer cannot be altered.

  DPX files do not have integral encryption or authentication. A 32-bit “encryption key” field is 
  defined in SMPTE ST 268-1, but the standard does not specify an encryption algorithm; therefore, 
  utilizing the field for encrypting picture data will generally not be interoperable. Any file 
  protection, privacy, or integrity requirements must be handled using an external mechanism.

  D.7 Interoperability considerations
  SMPTE ST 268-1 has been very widely used since it was standardized (initially as SMPTE 268M:1994) 
  but has experienced some interoperability issues in practice. These issues have occurred primarily 
  due to conflicting interpretations relating specifically to how the pixel data is ordered, packed, 
  and padded. SMPTE ST 268-2 has improved interoperability due to the inclusion of metadata that 
  resolves ambiguities that are present in ST 268-1. However, ST 268-2 is a more recent standard, 
  whereas ST 268-1 has been widely used for many years prior and is employed in voluminous archives.

  Both ST 268-1 and ST 268-2 define core fields and values. Files must include all core fields, and 
  reader or receiver implementations must interpret all core fields and values.

  D.8 Published specification
  SMPTE ST 268-1; SMPTE ST 268-2 (which incorporates ST 268-1 by reference)

  D.9 Applications which use this media
  DPX is derived from Kodak's Cineon format and is used primarily as a file format for digitization 
  of camera-captured frames and as a digital intermediate file format.

  D.10 Fragment identifier considerations
  N/A

  D.11 Restrictions on usage
  N/A

  D.12 Additional information
  
    D.12.1 Deprecated alias names for this type
    N/A

    D.12.2 Magic number(s)
    hex 53 44 50 58 (most-significant byte first file) or 58 50 44 53 (least-significant byte first file) 

    D.12.3 File extension(s) 
    dpx 

    D.12.4 Macintosh file type code
    N/A 

    D.12.5 Object Identifiers
    N/A

  D.13 Person to contact for further information
  Name: Director of Standards Development
  Email: standards-support&smpte.org

  D.14 Intended usage
  Common

  D.15 Author/Change controller
